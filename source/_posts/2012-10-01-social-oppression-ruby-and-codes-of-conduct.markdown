[Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com) is a valuable resource for teaching computer programming to kids.  It's a programming environment and a framework for providing interactive lessons.

Steve and Lindsey have joined up to produce [Anti-Oppression 101](http://rarlindseysmash.com/files/antioppression101.pdf), a presentation on gender discrimination in STEM careers, in the context of the larger issue of social oppression.

In Engine Yard's latest *Cloud Out Loud* podcast, [Social Oppresion, Ruby and Codes of Conduct](http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/social-oppression-ruby-and-codes-of-conduct), Steve and Lindsey talk about all forms of discrimination in technology education, hiring and the workplace.
